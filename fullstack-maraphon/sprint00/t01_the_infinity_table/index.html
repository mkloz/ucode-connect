                <td>The Soul Stone ranks as possibly the most dangerous of all the
                    Infinity Stones, with it holding a special standing among the
                    others. The sacrifices for the Stone are
                    permanent and irreversible, as not even the omnipotent
                    combination of the Six Stones could resurrect them. The Soul
                    Stone has the ability to manipulate the soul, the essence that
                    makes up an individual, and has the ability to resurrect and
                    conjure the spiritual representation of the people who are
                    dead.</td>

                <td>As the Infinity Stone that represents, describes and governs
                    over the flow of time, the Time Stone is among the most powerful
                    artifacts in all existence. Due to its power, it cannot be
                    held and used by anyone not powerful enough to withstand it,
                    thus forcing Agamotto to create the Eye of Agamotto as a
                    container to allow other sufficiently advanced sorcerers to
                    wield it.</td>

                <td>As the Infinity Stone that represents and governs over space,
                    the Space Stone grants the wielder absolute control over space itself.
                    It is primarily used to open portals to other locations and can even allow interdimensional travel.
                    As one of the six Infinity Stones, the Space Stone ranks as among the most powerful artifacts in the
                    universe,
                    with Black Widow saying it has the power to wipe out an entire planet.</td>

                <td>As the Infinity Stone that represents and governs the fabric of
                    mind, the Mind Stone grants whoever holds it complete control
                    over the hearts and minds of others. Like with all the other
                    Infinity Stones, it is among the most powerful artifacts in
                    all existence.</td>

                    the Reality Stone granted its user absolute control over reality
                    itself. However, like all other Infinity Stones, due to it being
                    the most powerful artifact in existence, it can only be wielded
                    by beings of sufficient power and inside beings of no powers,
                    it will inevitably kill them, as evidenced with Jane Foster.

                    destructive forces of the universe, the Power Stone grants its
                    wielder tremendous energy manipulation capabilities. Due to the
                    amount of energy the Power Stone releases, it is the most
                    destructive out of all the Infinity Stones in terms of raw
                    power.</td>
